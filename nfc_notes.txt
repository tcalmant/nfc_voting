Things may not immediately work on Linux for two reasons:
The reader might be claimed by the Linux NFC subsystem available since
Linux 3.1 and root privileges may be required to access the device.

To prevent a reader being used by the NFC kernel driver add a blacklist
entry in '/etc/modprobe.d/', for example the following line works for the
PN533 based SCL3711:

  $ echo "blacklist pn533" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nfc.conf


Root permissions are usually needed for the USB readers and 'sudo python'
is an easy fix, however not quite convinient and potentially dangerous.

A better solution is to add a udev rule and make the reader accessible to a
normal user, like the following rules would allow members of the
'plugdev' group to access an SCL-3711 or RC-S380 if stored in
'/etc/udev/rules.d/nfcdev.rules'.

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04e6", \
  ATTRS{idProduct}=="5591", GROUP="plugdev" # SCM SCL-3711
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="054c", \
  ATTRS{idProduct}=="06c1", GROUP="plugdev" # Sony RC-S380
